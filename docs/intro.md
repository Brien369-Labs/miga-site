> **MIGA** DAO consists of a group of volunteers who aspire to reinvigorate the ICP community and elevate the ICP ecosystem to a Top 5 blockchain in the world, as measured by CMC market cap. As of Nov 2024, [ICP is ranked 25th on CMC's league table](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/internet-computer). We want to make ICP great again!

> A decentralized, community-driven effort, **MIGA** will focus on three things:
>
>1. Host online events with KOLs from other ecosystems to exchange ideas and compare notes
> 
>2. Discover killer DApps in the world of ICP and promote these projects at early stage
>
>3. Review key NNS proposals and shepherd ICP community towards intellectural honesty and governance decentralization
